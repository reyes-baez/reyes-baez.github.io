I am a Research and Teaching [https://www.rug.nl/fse/ FSE]  fellow at the [http://www.rug.nl/ RuG]\.  



== Research Interests
I am mainly interested in the theory, engineering, technology and education of *systems and control*, with an emphasis on applications in modern technology.\n\n
 Specifically:\n
- Lyapunov, contractivity and passivity techniques in control of nonlinear systems
- Lagranian and port-Hamiltonian methods for modeling and control of physcal systems and networks
- Learning for dynamics and control: control-informed NNs, iterative learning
- Robotics and mechatronics: motion control of rigid and soft robots, high-precision control
- Applications: opto-mechatronics, biomedical engineering,  wind energy systems, smart industry\n

#- Education of engineering science: hybrid traditional-constructive teaching, online education of experimental subjects
